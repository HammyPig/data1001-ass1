# data1001-ass1
This was the first project for the Foundations of Data Science course DATA1001. 

It was a group project which because of Covid, was worth 0 marks. There were also meant to be 4 people working on the project, but this was cut to 2 (as students were either sick or couldn't get into the country). 

Therefore, this project does not show much interesting, however, it served as a good introduction to R, and how to tackle asking meaningful data-related questions. 

Another learning experience was the strategy for meaningful survey questions, and their relation to how easily the answers can be used (being aware of the data-type ideal to the situation), as well as the amount of detail necessary for a question to be clear and accurate to participants.
